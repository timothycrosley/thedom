    WebElements/__init__.py

    WebElements is a library that provides classes to represent sections of a page.
    At the most basic point a WebElement is a 1:1 mapping to a DOM object, however
    as WebElements can each contain child elements - a single WebElement from an
    API usage point of view can define any concept or widget on a web page no matter
    how complex.
